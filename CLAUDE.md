# t-hashmap

A hash map library written in T, the language at `~/repos/tooling/t-lang`
(GitHub: lkurcak/t-lang). Like tcalc (`~/repos/tooling/tcalc`), its real
purpose is to find out what using T is like, here for a library: writing
an interface, separate checking, a user-implemented `Hash` trait, the
orphan rule, API evolution. tcalc depends on it, by git rev, for its
variables.

- `lib.t` is the package's root (`Map`), `hash.t` the `hash` module
  (`Hash`, `Hasher`, `Probe`).
- `tests/run.sh` runs what CI runs; `tests/lib.t` is a dependent package
  of `#[test]`s (`t test tests/lib.t`).
- CI pins a `t` release (`T_VERSION` + `T_SHA256` in ci.yml); bump both
  after a t-lang release, from `gh release view vX.Y.Z -R lkurcak/t-lang
  --json assets`.
- `FRICTION.md` is the friction log: label entries gap / by design /
  unsure / works, with the code that hit them. It's evidence for t-lang
  steps, planned in t-lang, not here.
- `git` over ssh doesn't work in Claude's shell: push and fetch through
  `origin` with `-c url."https://github.com/".insteadOf=git@github.com:
  -c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential'`.
